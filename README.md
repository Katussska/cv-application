# 📝 CV Application - The Odin Project

In this project, I built an application where users can input their personal details and generate a CV/résumé.

## 🚀 Introduction

This project provides a simple but functional tool for generating a CV, focusing on applying core React concepts.

Includes:
- General information input: name, email, and phone number.
- Educational experience: school name, title of study, and study dates.
- Practical experience: company name, position title, job responsibilities, and dates worked.

The project also features:
- **Edit and Submit functionality** for each section.
- **Dynamic rendering** of input fields and displayed data.

## 📋 Assignment Overview

Here’s what the project entails:
- 🌱 Structuring the application into React components (under the `components` directory).
- 🎨 Applying styles via CSS (under the `styles` directory).
- 💾 Managing state and props effectively to enable edit and submit functionalities.
- 🌐 Deploying the project using a PaaS platform after pushing to GitHub.

## 🔍 Key Concepts Learned

- **State Management:** Used React’s state to track input values and render the CV.
- **Props:** Passed data between parent and child components for seamless communication.
- **Component Structure:** Broke down the UI into reusable and maintainable components.
- **Form Handling:** Managed controlled components to handle form input efficiently.
